In this case, the selected Slug-Catcher was of the finger type, a design consisting of a series of large-diameter pipes located in parallel whose arrangement provides for a slight slope to allow the separation of the gas-liquid.<br>The properties of the oil to be separated can be obtained in the laboratory using a combination of flash and differential vaporization experiments. If we have these data, they are the ones we should use. In this case, since they were not available, the program estimated them using empirical correlations.</p>

The road has an extension of 109.79 meters, and the heights of the towers are 20.87 meters.
The cables were verified as being the elements considered to have the least resistance and the structure as a simplified modeling of the deck and towers based on the data and considerations of the supplied documentation.</p>

The verification calculation was carried out with the PVelite program and ASME div1 was used as the design code.
I assumed that the equipment does not have any structural failure or thickness reduction and that it was fit for service.
Finally, the relief devices for the new conditions were verified.</p>
